## ENVIRONMENT
---

### Back-end

    *   Node >=18
    *   Python 3.11 + Flask (e.g. API routes outside from Node & API "/healt" content. Harder having both processes, but for educational purposes)

#### Dependencies for Server:

    * Dotenv
    * CORS
    * Axios
    
    * Bcrypt & Jsonwebtoken -> For tokenisation, better than using Auth Cookies everywhere
    
    * Mongoose -> API
    
    * Json-server, for API "/health" Router
