# Capstone Project Requirements

You must build a full stack web application that:
- Incorporates **microservices architecture**.
- Utilizes at least **60% original code** from tools learned in the course.

### Front End
- Must be built using **React**.
- Communicates with the back end via an **API** enabling CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

### Back End / Database
- Built using **Python** or another back end language with a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis) learned in the course.
- Integrating other languages or tools is allowed **with TA permission**.

### Proficiency
- Must demonstrate proficiency with topics covered in the course.

## You also must:
- Incorporate **one tool or feature not learned in the course** but acquired independently (requires TA approval if it is a new language or framework).  
- The application **must be mobile responsive**.  
  - If not feasible, explain the situation to a TA (e.g., browser-based game, detailed data visualizations).  
- Front end and back end must be **hosted and operational**. Provide working links.  
- Project **must include documentation** (auto-generated READMEs do **not** count). Must describe tools, languages, and key functionality.  
- Use of tutorials is allowed, but tutorial-derived material may **not exceed 40%** of the project.

## Project Submission Directions

Your project document should include:

- **Summary / Description** of your application  
  > Only Bottega staff will see this. More details can go in your `README.md`.
- **Live URLs** for front end and back end
- **GitHub Repository URLs** for front end and back end
- **Credentials / Hidden Routes** needed to test your application
- **Description of your self-taught tool / feature**
- Any **additional information** needed for assessment
